# RP2040 Mini SDR
I have always wanted to try out stuff with RF, especially receiving images from NOAA with my own stuff.  
So i thought that why not make it FM too. And then GPT told me i could legally listen to airband signals too. 

So, i planned to make out an SDR using the goated RP2040 chip and a few mixers and oscillators.  

I am in no way an RF expert and would love it if someone pointed out my errors and mailed them to [me](mailto:keyaan.1911@gmail.com) or DM on [hackclub](https://hackclub.com) Slack ```@Keyaan```

I think I am gonna make another RF board that could legally transmit too! but that's just an idea for now.
