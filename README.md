# RP2040 Mini SDR
This is an SDR, as the name says, and it can function in the FM, Airband and NOAA-APT bands ONLY AS A RECEIVER. This is completely legal to make and use.  
I have used RP2040 and ADE-11X+ mixer and SI5351 controllable clock. I thought that i would use a PCB trace USB but then i didn't do it because it would make the board cost go BOOOOM. So, normal USB-A.

I am in no way an RF expert and would love it if someone pointed out my errors and mailed them to [me](mailto:keyaan.1911@gmail.com) or DM on [hackclub](https://hackclub.com) Slack ```@Keyaan```

I think I am gonna make another RF board that could legally transmit too! but that's just an idea for now. 

I am not making a 3D model for this project as i feel this is not required for now. 

# Why I chose to make this project
I have always wanted to try out stuff with RF, especially receiving images from NOAA with my own stuff(I have used [WebSDRs](https://websdr.org) before).  
So i thought that why not make it FM too. And then GPT told me i could legally listen to airband signals too. 

So, i planned to make out an SDR using the goated RP2040 chip and a few mixers and oscillators.  

I have used an SMA connector as it is the most common one i think.
